            <h3>Who are hedgehogs good pets for?</h3>
            <p>Pet hedgehogs are quiet, active, entertaining, and low maintenance. They are nocturnal, making them a good pet for someone who has a 9 to 5 job. These solitary animals prefer to be housed alone and may fight if kept with other hedgehogs. Therefore they are good for people that are only looking for one friendly critter.</p>

            <h3>Four things you should know about them:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a responsible hedgehog breeder - not everyone selling hedgehogs takes appropriate care of them.</li>
                <li>They're very sensitive - remain calm and gentle around them.</li>
                <li>They love unusual scents - hedgehogs respond to specific scents by anointing, i.e. rubbing them all over his body.</li>
                <li>Respect their nocturnal schedule - hedgehogs are nocturnal and it's important to respect that, and not force them to be active during the day.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Final considerations:</h3>
            <p>Domesticated pet hedgehogs should be fed pelleted formulas manufactured specifically for hedgehogs while being supplemented with a limited number of insects (mealworms, crickets, earthworms, waxworms) and a small amount of fruits and vegetables, such as beans, peas, corn, apples, and carrots. Just as with other companion animals, it's important to do your homework before buying a hedgehog. If you feel like you meet all the above criteria and would love to care for your very own hedgie then feel free to find one that you would like to adopt.</p>
